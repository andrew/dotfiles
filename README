This is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it but this one is mine. My dotfiles repo is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my dotfiles repo is useless. Without my dotfiles repo I am useless. I must fire my dotfiles repo true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my dotfiles repo and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
